# env\_overview\_ftek
A tool for maintaining an overview of the environmental impact by Physics student union at Chalmers TH.

## Implementation plan
Easy:
    Google sheet with links to google docs

Ambitious:
    Seemless integration on ftek with javascript or similar with documentation in latex. Contribution either by email or merge requests on github or similar.

## Wishlist
 - List with possible areas of improvement
    * Should be easy for anyone (or at least *foreningsaktiva*) to contribute to list
 - Evaluation of environmental and sustainability impact
    * With link to documentation of grounds
    * Possibility to peer-review said documentation
 - Evaluation of ease of implementation
    * With link to documentation of grounds
    * Possibility to peer-review said documentation
 - Ease of use: possibility of sorting depending on criteria, graphs?,...
 - Also keeping negative results (areas evaluated to not have improvement possibility should remain) and in that way avoiding
